Short Weekly Assignments
------------------------

Each week, each student is required to read both assigned papers. To facilitate discussion and analysis of each paper, students are required to send the instructors one question for each paper (2 questions / week) the day prior to the scheduled class. The questions can be related to anything in the papers, including data, methodology, techniques, and / or results analysis. The questions will be discussed during class.

Written Assignment (Due Week 7)
-------------------------------

In Week 3 we will distribute a 4–5 page research paper in a format comparable to those we have covered in previous classes. The title, three data figures and two paragraphs of the results sections will be omitted. Students are required to suggest an appropriate title and propose written sections and illustrate the missing figures. The data and written results section should support the conclusions described in the paper. Do not look up the original research paper. The purpose of this exercise is to develop your understanding of the different sections of a research paper. Students will practice interpreting results by drawing the figures and describing the data.

Oral Presentation (Due in the Final Class)
------------------------------------------

Students will be required to select one paper from the primary literature (to be approved by instructors) and prepare a 15–minute PowerPoint or Keynote presentation (10–15 slides) to be delivered during the last class session. Papers can be about any subject related to the glycobiology topics discussed in class. Presentations should include a summary of background and techniques (2–3 slides) and a critical analysis of the methods, data, controls, and author’s data interpretation (6–10 slides). Evaluate how the experiments were conducted by focusing on key figures and tables, and explain if they warrant the conclusions. Students should also comment about possible future directions the research might lead to (1 slide). The oral presentation should trigger a discussion with the entire group. Be prepared to answer 3 questions from other students and the instructors during your presentation. The instructors will be available to meet with students about this exercise as needed. First paper choices must be submitted by Week 8, and the final selection should be made by Week 9.
