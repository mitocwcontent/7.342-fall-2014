description: In this photograph of a three-day-old zebrafish jaw, glycan patterns
  are labeled in red, green, and yellow, helping researchers to study how organisms
  develop, and identify markers for disease. See Lecture Summary 3 to learn more about
  imaging glycan patterns in developing embryos. (Image by Carolyn Bertozzi, University
