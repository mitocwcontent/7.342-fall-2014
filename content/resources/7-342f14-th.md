  caption: In this photograph of a three-day-old zebrafish jaw, glycan patterns are
    labeled in red, green, and yellow, helping researchers to study how organisms
    develop, and identify markers for disease. See [Lecture Summary 3](pages/lecture-summaries/#Week_3)
    to learn more about imaging glycan patterns in developing embryos. (Image by Carolyn
